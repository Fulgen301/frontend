  Lorry: '''
    <p>Lorry is to become <i>the</i> platform for Clonk add-ons - CCAN 2.0, so to say!</p>
    <p>The project is still in an early alpha phase. See the <a href='https://clonkspot.org/forum/topic_show.pl?tid=30'>mini blog</a> for discussions and status updates!</p>
    '''

  OpenClonk: '''
    <p>OpenClonk is the successor of the Clonk game series, developed as open source project. The team explores completely new avenues like real time 3D models.</p>
    <p>But no worries, at its core the game remains our good old 2D platformer!</p>
